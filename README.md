# 🌳 WasteNot

> From expiring to inspiring: Smart food management.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq | Sustainable Food Management for Zero Waste**

---

## 🎯 Objective

WasteNot tackles the global challenge of food waste by providing individuals with an intuitive tool to track food expiration dates, monitor freshness, and receive recipe suggestions based on items nearing expiry.

According to the FAO, approximately one-third of food produced for human consumption is wasted globally. Our application serves environmentally-conscious consumers who want to reduce their household food waste, save money, and make more sustainable choices.
